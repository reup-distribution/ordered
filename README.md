# ordered-cljs

A ClojureScript fork of [org.flatland/ordered](https://github.com/amalloy/ordered).

ordered provides sets and maps that maintain the insertion order of their contents.

## Sets

```clojure
(require '[flatland.ordered.set :refer [ordered-set]])

(ordered-set 4 3 1 8 2)
=> #ordered/set (4 3 1 8 2)

(conj (ordered-set 9 10) 1 2 3)
=> #ordered/set (9 10 1 2 3)

(into (ordered-set) [7 6 1 5 6])
=> #ordered/set (7 6 1 5)

(disj (ordered-set 8 1 7 2 6) 7)
=> #ordered/set (8 1 2 6)

;; Adding an element already in an ordered set does not change its
;; position in the order.
(conj (ordered-set 4 3 1 8 2) 8)
=> #ordered/set (4 3 1 8 2)

;; Removing an element, then adding it back in, puts it at the end,
;; just as it would if it were never part of the set.
(-> (ordered-set 4 3 1 8 2) (disj 8) (conj 8))
=> #ordered/set (4 3 1 2 8)
```

## Maps

```clojure
(require '[flatland.ordered.map :refer [ordered-map]])

(ordered-map :b 2 :a 1 :d 4)
=> #ordered/map ([:b 2] [:a 1] [:d 4])

(assoc (ordered-map :b 2 :a 1 :d 4) :c 3)
=> #ordered/map ([:b 2] [:a 1] [:d 4] [:c 3])

(into (ordered-map) [[:c 3] [:a 1] [:d 4]])
=> #ordered/map ([:c 3] [:a 1] [:d 4])

(dissoc (ordered-map :c 3 :a 1 :d 4) :a)
=> #ordered/map ([:c 3] [:d 4])

;; Adding a key already in an ordered map does not change its position
;; in the order.
(assoc (ordered-map :b 2 :a 1 :d 4) :b 7)
=> #ordered/map ([:b 7] [:a 1] [:d 4])

;; Removing a key, then adding it back in, puts it at the end, just as
;; it would if it were never part of the map.
(-> (ordered-map :b 2 :a 1 :d 4) (dissoc :b) (assoc :b 7))
=> #ordered/map ([:a 1] [:d 4] [:b 7])
```
